# 1.0.2



* smart search optimization: implemented the 20-character limit 
* bug fix (double space): added a trimming function to remove invisible whitespace at the end of level names, fixing the "double space" bug (e.g., on levels like yatagarasu).
* the " startpos" suffix is now intelligently shortened to fit as much information as possible into the search bar.



# 1.0.1



* new ui layout: moved the button next to the difficulty sprite for a cleaner, more integrated look.
* resizing: reduced button scale to 0.5x to make it less intrusive and more consistent with a GDDP vibe.
* dedicated menu: created an invisible sub-menu to handle positioning without interfering with other ui elements.



# 1.0.0



* initial release: added a button to quickly search for "startpos" versions of levels directly from the level info screen.
* custom icon: reused the practice mode icon with a cyan tint for easy identification.
